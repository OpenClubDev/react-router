Declarative routing for [React](https://facebook.github.io/react).

React Router keeps your UI in sync with the URL. Make the URL your first thought, not an after-thought.

## Installation

Using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

    $ npm install --save teardrop@5.0.0

Then with a module bundler like [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/), use as you would anything else:

```js
// using an ES6 transpiler, like babel
import { BrowserRouter, Match, Link, Miss } from 'teardrop'

// not using an ES6 transpiler
var BrowserRouter = require('teardrop').BrowserRouter
var Match = require('teardrop').Match
var Link = require('teardrop').Link
var Miss = require('teardrop').Miss
```

You can find the library on `window.Teardrop`.

## Docs

We're going to try and get the docs sorted out here.

## v6 FAQ

### Why rename and fork teardrop?

We weren't happy with the direction of teardrop, so we've decided to branch out and provide our own version.

### Will you do huge API overhauls?

No, we're not about that. We'll try and ensure everything is backwards compatible for as long as possible.

### Why Match, Miss instead of Route?

We like it.

### What about route transition hooks?

Transition's can be done within render of a Match.

```js
<Match render={() => {
  doStuffHere();
  return <ComponentHere />
}}/>
```

One use case was loading data and waiting to render the next screen until the data landed. With a component, you can save the previous children, render them while loading, and then render your new children when you're done. We'll have an example of this eventually.

### I liked seeing all my routes in one place, now what?

Check out the "Route Config" example.
